<h2>Early Life</h2>
		<p>Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California. He grew up with his adoptive parents Clara and Paul Jobs in Mountain View, California where he discovered his love for technology while working on electronics in his garage alongside his father. Jobs has always been exceptionally intelligent, however as a child he did not apply himself to learning while at school. Jobs attended Homestead High School, which is where he would eventually meet his future partner, Steve Wozniak.</p>
<h2>College Career</h2>
		<p>Steve Jobs attended a private liberal arts college called Reed College in Portland, Oregon for a single semester in 1972 before dropping out. However, he still attended classes at the college for another year and a half without paying or receiving credits. He went to many creative classes and later said in an interview that a calligraphy course he took steered the typography he chose when designing the Mac.
<h2>Beginning of Adulthood</h2>
		<p>After deciding to stop attending classes at Reed College, Steve Jobs took a position as a video game designer with Atari, where he often caused conflict among the other employees and himself. After several months with the company he left to find "spiritual enlightenment" in India while experimenting with psychedelic drugs. Soon after returning from his trip he found out his college girlfriend was pregnant with his baby. He does not accept responsibility, denying he is the father.</p> 
<h2>The Start of Something Great</h2>
		<p> In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, his highschool friend and newly found business partner began Apple Computers. The duo started in the Jobs family garage, funding their company by selling Jobs' Volkswagen bus and Wozniak's scientific calculator. Apple would go on to become the largest, most profitable computer company in the world.
<h2>Later Life</h2>
		<p>Later on in his life Steve Jobs met Laurene Powell, an American business woman. They got married on March 18, 1991 and moved to a home in Palo Alto, California. The couple eventually had three children and Jobs was finally able to accept his first daughter, Lisa. Jobs worked hard at improving his company and developing new technology until his death on October 5, 2011 due to pancreatic cancer. Even though Steve Jobs has passed away, his legacy will endure on forever.
