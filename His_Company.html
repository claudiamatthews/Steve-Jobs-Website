<h2>The Beginning</h2>
		<p>Apple, the company that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded in 1976 experienced many struggles before its worldly success. The first computer Jobs and Wozniak ever marketed was named Apple I. Wozniak created it and Jobs helped to market it after he realized it's potential. The duo sold this product to a computer shop owner in San Francisco, California. After that, their company grew greatly. They began work on another computer named Lisa. Jobs wanted Lisa to have all the best software. This lead to him over designing the computer, causing him to go overbudget. The final cost of the Lisa was $11,000 and was deemed a failure due to its cost. After this mass failure Jobs was voted off the board but given a project to work on. He and his team created the computer, the Mac, which was also exceptionally expensive and deemed a failure. After two failures, Jobs left Apple in 1985. During his time apart from Apple he created NEXT Inc, another computer company and purchased an animation company, Pixar Animation Studios. In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as the CEO. He was able to revitalize the company and pull them out of their financial troubles. Jobs put Apple back on track with new innovative ideas and designs that caught the attention of the public. Jobs spent the rest of his life working to improve Apple and their products.
		
<h2>Where Apple Is Today</h2>
		<p>Apple has greatly outgrown the Jobs' family garage it started out of in 1976. Since then it has become the world's idea of innovation and technology. Over the years Apple has released a variety of products. Some of their biggest successes include the iPod, iPhone, and MacBook Air. Apple products are considered reliable and high-tech, two of the many reasons why millions of people use them everyday.</p>
